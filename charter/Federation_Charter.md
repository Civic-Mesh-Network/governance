# Civic Mesh Federation â€” Charter (Draft)
**Purpose:** Help neighborhoods stand up community-owned meshes.
**Principles:** dignity, consent, transparency, minimal data, open formats.
**Membership:** neighborhood orgs; local autonomy by default.
**Change:** open PR + 2-week comment window.

This charter is intentionally lightweight; neighborhoods extend it locally.
